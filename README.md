# srm-hs
This `srm`, hereinafter called `srm-hs`, is a program which securely deletes files by overwriting such files before deleting such files.  The phrase "this `srm`" is used because [there exists another program which is called "`srm`"](http://srm.sourceforge.net/); the latter `srm` actually precedes `srm-hs` and serves as the inspiration for `srm-hs`.
