# srm-hs
This `srm`, hereinafter called `srm-hs`, is a program which securely deletes files by overwriting such files before deleting such files.  The phrase "this `srm`" is used because [there exists another program which is called "`srm`"](http://srm.sourceforge.net/); the latter `srm` actually precedes `srm-hs` and serves as the inspiration for `srm-hs`.

## "Why Is the Executable Caled '`srm`', Not '`srm-hs`'?"
Theorem.  The executable name "`srm`" is chosen over the executable name "`srm-hs`".

Proof.

For all executable names _a_, for all executable names _b_, the ease of typing _a_ is greater than the ease of typing _b_ only if _a_ is chosen over _b_.

The ease of typing the executable name "`srm`" is greater than the ease of typing the executable name "`srm-hs`".

Therefore, the executable name "`srm`" is chosen over the executable name "`srm-hs`".  Q.E.D.
