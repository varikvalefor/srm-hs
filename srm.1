.Sh NAME
.Nm srm
.Nd securely remove files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm srm
.Op Fl GPsX
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm srm
is a small program which overwrites files before deleting such files,
thereby hopefully preventing the recovery of such files.
.Pp
.Nm srm
is designed such that
.Nm srm
is
.Em mostly
compatible with the
.Nm srm
of
.An MATT GAUTHIER.
See
.Lk http://sourceforge.net/projects/srm/ "the project's Web page" .
.Sh OPTIONS
The options of
.Nm srm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl G
.Nm srm
.Fl G
.Pa file Op ...
overwrites
.Pa file
et al. in accordance with the GUTMANN method.
.Pp
The Wikipedia article regarding this
method of data sanitisation is actually fairly decent.  See
.Lk http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmann_method "Gutmann method" .
.It Fl P
.Nm srm
.Fl P
.Pa file Op ...
overwrites
.Pa file
et al. in accordance with OpenBSD's old
.Nm rm Fl P
functionality.
.Pa file
et al. are overwritten with bytes
.Sy 00 ,
then
.Sy FF ,
then
.Sy 00 .
.It Fl s
.Nm srm
.Fl s
.Pa file Op ...
overwrites
.Pa file
et al. with null bytes.  This thing is not particularly secure... but
should at least ward off script kiddies.
.It Fl X
.Nm srm
.Fl X
.Ar y
.Pa file Op ...
overwrites
.Pa file
and cohorts with pseudorandom data
.Ar y
times, where
.Ar y
is a natural number.
.Pp
Hopefully somewhat amusingly, the
.Fl X
option supports arbitrarily large numbers of passes.  Feel free to wipe
the hard disk until the cows come home... or until the heat death of the
universe occurs.  But please stop writing stuff to the disk if the heat
death of the universe occurs.

.Sh QUIRKS
.Ss DELETING FILES WHOSE NAMES BEGIN WITH HYPHENS
For all current-directory-based filenames
.Va f ,
.Va f
matches the regular expression /-\\w+/ only if
.Nm srm
.Va f
likely fails.  This problem can be overcome by prepending
.Dq ./
to
.Va f .
.Pp
Note that this problem only affects files whose given paths begin with
hyphens; qualified paths, e.g.,
.Pa /home/dummy/Documents/-reasons-to-not-eat-the-paint.tex ,
are unaffected.

Mad props to
